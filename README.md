# ExtremeMenuNavigation

Game about navigating menus

## Details

My friends and I enjoy playing games online and we sometimes find that getting together in a lobby and getting connected can be nightmarish in some games. We joke that we need to play "Extreme Menu Navigation" before actually playing the game we want to play. We decided to extend this inside joke into an actual game to learn Bevy.
